## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python

My first OAuth api I created using Instagrams developer documentation. This was very challenging as it was also my first time building a server and hosting it locally. the picture shown was of me ofcourse. it was a great representation of how I felt after taking all night to figure this out.

## Lessons Learned:

Learned how to build a server and host it locally. I also learned of OAuth APIs and now I am comfortable with using them for future endeavors.
